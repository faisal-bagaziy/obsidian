## intro 

- 2 types of companies 
	1. have been breached and know it
	2. have been breached and don't know it

## IT Security Incidents: A Major Concern
- Business managers, IT professionals, and IT users all face a number of  
ethical decisions regarding IT security, such as the following:
- if a company/ org is a victim of computer crime
	-  should it pursue prosecution of the criminals at  all costs, maintain a low profile to avoid the negative publicity, inform its affected customers, or take some   other action?
- How much effort and money should be spent to safeguard against computer crime? (In other words, ==how  safe is safe enough==?
- If a company realizes that it ==has produced software with defects== that make it possible for hackers to attack customer data and computers, what actions should it take?
- What should be done if recommended computer security safeguards make conducting business more  difficult for customers and employees, resulting in lost sales and increased costs?

## Why Computer Incidents Are So Prevalent
1. Increasing Complexity Increases Vulnerability.  
	- The computing environment has become enormously complex  
	- cloud computing environment  
	- Virtualization software
2. Increasing Sophistication of Those Who Would Do Harm  
	- Today’s computer attacker has greater depth of knowledge and expertise.  
	- Today’s computer menace is much better organized and may be  part of an organized group (for example, Anonymous, Chaos Computer Club...etc.)
3. Expanding and Changing Systems Introduce New Risks  
	- Business has moved from an era of stand-alone computers to an era in which personal  computers connect to networks with millions of other computers
4. Increasing Prevalence of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policies  
	- Increased the productivity & the complexity.
	- In addition, BYOD makes it extremely difficult for IT organizations to adequately safeguard additional portable devices with various operating systems and a myriad of applications.
5. Growing Reliance on Commercial Software with Known Vulnerabilities
	-  Increased Reliance on Commercial Software with Known Vulnerabilities  
	- Exploit is an attack on an information system that takes advantage of a particular system vulnerability.  
	- this attack is due to poor system design or implementation.  
	- Once the vulnerability is discovered, software developers create and issue a “fix,” or patch, to eliminate the problem.
	- e.g. Oracle’s Java 7 software
